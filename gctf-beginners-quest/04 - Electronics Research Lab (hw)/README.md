>Well, it’s a rather gloomy and messy apartment, a faint shade is cast from the almost covered master window upon the worn wall. It smells very burnt, and there's a cracked bottle in the sink that suggests some kind of experiment. Someone must have left in a hurry. Thinking about it, do you want to: Look at the beautiful view of the Kremlin from the window or search the apartment thoroughly  
> **> Search it thoroughly (4)**  
> AGENT X seems to have missed that a plank on the floorboard has become very loose. You have a look and you see some kind of device under it. If you’re lucky, some information on it might come in handy. You have to travel back to the base if you wish to find out more.

Dr Klostermann: "Welcome to the technical department AGENT, I’m Dr. Klostermann, and this is my assistant, Konstantin. Let’s not waste any time, is that the device that you’re holding in your hand?
