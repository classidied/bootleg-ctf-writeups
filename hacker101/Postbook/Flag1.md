## Hints
- Try viewing your own post and then see if you can change the ID

## Solution
Each post has an `id` attribute:

The posts that you (as **user**) makes start at `id=3`, and the first post from **admin** has `id=1`, so we can test `id=2`. 

Doing so, we get a secret post from **admin** and the flag:
