# picoCTF 2021
I participated in CanHack 2021 through Ryerson back in March and didn't think to document anything properly; this is an attempt to:
1. remember everything I learned in the hopes that I'll improve
2. solve the challenges I wasn't able to do/figure out more elegant solutions than guessing/ctrl-f or whatever else I did
